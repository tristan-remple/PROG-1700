FILE STRUCTURE

Tristan's Generic Themes need a certain file structure to work correctly. The location of the main file will be considered the Root Directory. If you are using more than one Generic Theme, you may use the same Root Directory for all of them. Also in that Root Directory, you will need up to 4 folders:

-css (for the stylesheet)
-frames (for elements that appear on more than one page)
-img (for all of the images that display on the main page, if you're hosting your own images)
-js (for scripts)

MODIFYING

All files contain instructions on how to use and modify them. These instructions will also tell you where to place the file.

FONTS (RECOMMENDED)

If you wish to use fonts other than the ones included with the themes, you will need to include a link to the font source. Google Fonts make this very easy, I would recommend using them: https://fonts.google.com/

Fonts need to be replaced in the CSS using Find + Replace.

They ALSO need to be referenced in the Head of your HTML. There will be a note in the HTML files telling you where to put them.

FONTS (OTHER)

If you use one of the 11 default web fonts, you can apply it to the CSS only and it will work.

If you use Windows fonts or other OS-specific fonts, they will appear on devices running that OS but not on other devices. On other devices, they'll display as one of the default web fonts.
